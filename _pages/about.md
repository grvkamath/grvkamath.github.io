I am a 4th-year PhD student in Linguistics at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a>, and a member of the McGill University Linguistic Department's <a href="https://mcqll.org/">Montreal Quantitative and Computational Linguistics Laboratory</a>. I work under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://sivareddy.in">Siva Reddy</a>, and hold a doctoral grant from the <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/">Fonds de recherche du Québec</a>. I'm primarily interested in semantics, NLP, and intersections of the two: how formal theories of semantics/linguistics can help our understanding of large language models, and how large language models can inform our theories of semantics/linguistics. Questions that currently interest me: what semantic structures do LLMs capture? How does this compare to the ways in which humans interpret such structures? And what systems of meaning representation can we come up with more generally?

Outside of research, I also like to teach, having done so in varying capacities since my time as an undergraduate. And outside of academia entirely, I enjoy reading fiction, going bouldering, listening to a wide variety of music, and watching football/soccer (I support Arsenal, although <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LOMjTy9.jpg">sometimes I wonder why</a>).

How to pronounce my name: \[ˈɡɐwˌrəv\], \[ˈɡɑˌrəv\], or anything else vaguely similar.
