I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Linguistics at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a>, under Professor <a href="https://sivareddy.in/">Siva Reddy</a>, and a member of the McGill University Linguistic Department's <a href="https://mcqll.org/">Montreal Quantitative and Computational Linguistics Laboratory</a>. I'm primarily interested in semantics, NLP, and intersections of the two. Questions that currently interest me: what semantic structures do large language models like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21355768/gpt-3-ai-openai-turing-test-language">GPT-3</a> capture? Can deep learning methods help us build a formal distributional semantics? And what systems of meaning representation can we come up with more generally?

From my prior background in philosophy, I have further interests in _expressive language_—a class of language that includes pejoratives, slurs and exclamatives—and the study of philosophy more broadly. Outside of research, I also like to teach, having done so in varying capacities since my time as an undegraduate. And outside of academia entirely, I enjoy reading fiction, going bouldering, listening to wide variety of music, and watching football/soccer (I support Arsenal, although <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LOMjTy9.jpg">sometimes I wonder why</a>).

This website was last updated (and also first went up) on 26/09/2022. I'll be adding more stuff to it (a CV, pages for teaching, research, etc.) in the near future.
